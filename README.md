Mitochondrial Dynamics Involved in Drug Resistance to Cisplatin in CCA

Cisplatin resistance poses a significant challenge in cholangiocarcinoma chemotherapy.This study clarifies the cisplatin resistance mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma.By sequencing and analyzing RNA from cisplatin-treated cholangiocarcinoma cell lines of various origins, we identified a gene set and gene change patterns closely associated with cisplatin resistance.This model validates our perspective and provides a detailed map of cisplatin resistance in cholangiocarcinoma.In this section, we detail the RNAseq data utilized, highlighting the variations in RNA profiles for various bile duct cancers across different time points and cisplatin concentrations.

The code for R-based bioinformatics analysis in this study is available here.
